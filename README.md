# GoControlPanel plugins

The plugin marketplace of [GoControlPanel](https://github.com/MRegterschot/gocontrolpanel). Every panel,
self-hosted ones included, reads the index published from this repository and installs plugins from it.

- **Panels read** `https://mregterschot.github.io/tmcontrolpanel-plugins/index.json`, built by the
  *Publish marketplace* workflow on every push to `main`.
- **Pull requests are the review.** A plugin version is public once its pull request is merged.
- **Packages are pinned.** Every version is pinned by sha256 and copied to the site, and panels only
  download from the site. A replaced release asset fails the build instead of reaching panels.

## Publishing a plugin

1. Build the package with the SDK (see the
   [plugin SDK guide](https://github.com/MRegterschot/gocontrolpanel/blob/master/docs/plugin-sdk.md)):

   ```bash
   tmcp-plugin pack            # dist/<slug>-<version>.zip, prints its sha256
   ```

2. Attach the zip to a release of your plugin's repository.
3. Open a pull request that adds `plugins/<slug>/versions/<version>.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "url": "https://github.com/you/your-plugin/releases/download/v1.0.0/your-plugin-1.0.0.zip",
     "sha256": "<printed by tmcp-plugin pack>",
     "publishedAt": "2026-10-04T12:00:00Z",
     "changelog": "What changed in this version"
   }
   ```

   Optionally add `plugins/<slug>/plugin.json` with `tags` and `screenshots` (images in the same
   folder). Name, description, author and links come from the package's `tmcp-plugin.json`.

4. The *Check plugins* workflow downloads the package, checks the sha256 and validates it the way a
   panel does. A maintainer then reviews the code.

The first version of a slug claims it. Later versions of that slug are only accepted from the same author.

## Reviewing

Packages contain one unminified JavaScript bundle (`index.js`), the manialink templates and the
manifest. Before merging, check:

- **Capabilities.** Does the plugin need every one it declares? `players:moderate` and `mode:control`
  need a reason. `http:<host>` hosts must be the plugin's own service or a well-known API.
- **Code.** `index.js` should match the linked source. Look for obfuscated code, `eval`/`Function`,
  and data sent to hosts the README doesn't mention.
- **Templates.** Manialinks run ManiaScript on players' game clients. Look for `OpenLink`, HTTP
  requests from ManiaScript (`Http.CreateGet`/`CreatePost`), and anything that tracks players.
- **Behaviour.** Install the version on a test server (Plugins page → upload the zip) and use it.

## Withdrawing a version

Set `"yanked": true` and a `"yankReason"` in the version file instead of deleting it. Panels check the
index every 30 minutes. They turn the version off on every server that runs it, tell the server's
admins why, and refuse to install it again. To take down a whole plugin, yank every version.

## Reporting a plugin

Use the *Report a plugin* issue form. Panels link to it from every plugin page.
