# Match

Manages a match on the server: starting and stopping it, pausing, a pick and ban phase and a lobby.

A first-party GoControlPanel plugin. Permissions: `ui`, `chat:send`, `maps:read`, `maps:write`, `mode:control`.

## Events

Other plugins listen with `ctx.on("match:<event>", (payload) => ...)`. Panels without plugin events ignore them.

| Event | When | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `started` | The match started | `{ script }` |
| `stopped` | The match was stopped | none |
| `pauseChanged` | The match was paused or unpaused | `{ paused, login }` |
| `pickBanStarted` | The pick and ban phase began | `{ mode, order, maps }` |
| `pickBanTurn` | A new turn began | `{ action, login, players, nickName, timeoutSeconds }` |
| `pickBanMapPicked` | A map was picked | `{ map, by, position, timedOut }` |
| `pickBanMapBanned` | A map was banned | `{ map, by, timedOut }` |
| `pickBanCompleted` | The result is final and the match is ready to start | `{ mode, picked, banned }` |

A map is `{ uid, name, filename }`. `by` is the player's or team's name, or `"random"` for a random step. `timedOut` is true when the turn ran out of time and a random map was chosen. `picked` lists the maps in match order, each with `position` and `by`; `banned` lists the bans with `by`.
